## Introduction
Welcome to the CLI and ORM application project! This project is the culmination of learning Python fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, SQL fundamentals, table relations in SQL, object-relational mapping with Python, and building CLIs.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the Python code examples, ensure you have the following prerequisites and dependencies set up:
   - Python Installation: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The code is written for Python 3.x, so any version above Python 3.0 should work.
   - PIP: Pythonâ€™s package installer, PIP, should be installed to handle library dependencies.

## ORM Requirements
The application includes a database created and modified with Python ORM methods. The data model includes at least 2 model classes and at least 1 one-to-many relationships. Property methods are defined to add appropriate constraints to each model class. Each model class includes ORM methods (create, delete, get all, and find by id at minimum).

## CLI Requirements
The CLI displays menus with which a user may interact. The CLI uses loops as needed to keep the user in the application until they choose to exit. For EACH class in the data model, the CLI includes options: to create an object, delete an object, display all objects, view related objects, and find an object by attribute. The CLI validates user input and object creations/deletions, providing informative errors to the user.

## Creating a Python File
1. Open your text editor.
2. Create a new file and save it with a `.py` extension. For example, `employees.py`.

## Writing a Python Program
Write your Python code in the file. For example:

![alt text](image5.png)

Save the file.

## Running a Python Program
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
3. Run the Python file using the following command:

```bash
python3 employees.py
```

You should see the output of the program.

## Additional Tips
- Use comments and docstrings to document your code.
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- Test your code thoroughly before deploying it.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
git git@github.com:L35han/phase3-final-project.git
```

## Conclusion
This project is a great way to apply the skills you've learned in Python, SQL, and CLI building. It's open-ended, so feel free to create whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates the requirements listed above.
